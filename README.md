# BioREDirect

This project provides the implementation of our work "Enhancing Biomedical Relation Extraction with Directionality"

## Updates

Updated BioREDirect to the Python 3.11 version

## Environment

- GPU: Our experiments were conducted on an Nvidia A100 GPU. BioREDirect was also tested on Nvidia V100 and RTX 3080 GPUs. However, for fine-tuning on these GPUs, a smaller batch size, such as 8 for the V100 and 4 for the RTX 3080, may be required.
- Python: Python 3.11
- OS: Linux/Windows WSL2 with Conda

## Installation

Open a terminal or Anaconda Prompt and create a new environment. Then install Torch-gpu (check the latest from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/):

```bash
conda create -n bioredirect python=3.11
conda activate bioredirect
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Optional) Use the following command to check whether PyTorch can access the GPU after installation.

```bash
python src/run_check_torch_gpu.py
```

## Train and evaluate BioREDirect

### Step 1: Download the datasets

You can download [our converted datasets](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/BioREDirect/datasets.zip), and unzip it to 

```
datasets/
```

(Optional) If you want to convert the datasets by yourself, you can use the below script to convert original datasets into our input format.

```bash
bash scripts/build_biored_dataset.sh
```

You can change the above script to build_cdr_dataset.sh for the BC5CDR task experiment.

### Step 2: Download the pre-trained model

Please download the model [here](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/BioREx/biorex_biolinkbert_pt.zip)

Unzip it into 

```
biorex_biolinkbert_pt/
```

### Step 3: Running the BioRED task experiment

To train and evaluate the model, execute script/run_biored_bc8_exp.sh

```bash
bash scripts/run_biored_bc8_exp.sh
```

You can also change the above script to run_cdr_exp.sh for the BC5CDR task experiment.

## Predicting New Data:

If you only wish to use our tool for predicting new data without the need for training, please follow the steps outlined below:

Download the BioREDirect pre-trained model [BioREDirect BioRED model](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/BioREDirect/bioredirect_biored_pt.zip) file and place it in the "BioREDirect/" directory.
Open the "scripts/run_test_pred.sh" file and modify the values of the variables "in_pubtator_file" and "out_pubtator_file" to match your input PubTator file (with NER/ID annotations) and the desired output PubTator file (where predicted relations will be stored).

Execute the following script to initiate the prediction process:

```
bash scripts/run_test_pred.sh
```
